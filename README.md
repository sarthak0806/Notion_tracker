# Notion Subpages Latest Edited Time (IST)

A simple Streamlit app to view each subpage of a Notion page and display the most recent edit time (in Indian Standard Time) among all its nested children (pages and databases).

## Features

- **Super Fast:** Uses Pythonâ€™s `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for concurrent API requests, making it much faster than traditional sequential or threaded approaches.
- **Secure:** No API keys or secrets are stored; users provide their own Notion API key and Page ID.
- **Easy to use:** Enter your credentials and view results in a clean, sortable table.
- **Time zone conversion:** All times are shown in IST (Indian Standard Time).
- **No installation required:** Deployable on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or run locally.

## How It Works

- The app leverages **async programming** with `aiohttp` to fetch and traverse Notion blocks concurrently.
- This approach is especially efficient for large Notion pages or deep hierarchies, drastically reducing wait times compared to traditional recursive or threaded methods.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarthak0806/Notion_tracker.git
cd Notion_tracker
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
# If you run into issues, make sure you have aiohttp, streamlit, and requests installed:
# pip install aiohttp streamlit requests
```

### 3. Run the App Locally

```bash
streamlit run notion_sync.py
```

## Usage

1. **Obtain your Notion Integration Token (API Key):**  
   [Create an integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and copy the secret.
2. **Share your Notion page with the integration** (so it has access).
3. **Copy the Notion Page ID** from the URL of your page.
4. **Enter your API Key and Page ID** in the app and click "Fetch Subpages".
5. **View the table** of subpages and their latest edited times (in IST).

## Security

- **No secrets are stored or logged.**
- Each user provides their own Notion API key and Page ID.
- **Never share your API key publicly.**

## Example Table

| Page Name                 | Page ID                                   | Latest Edited (IST)     |

## Why Async & aiohttp?

- **Concurrency:** Fetches multiple subpages and their children at once.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces total API traversal time dramatically.
- **Scalability:** Handles large and deeply nested Notion pages with ease.
